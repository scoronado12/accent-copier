# accent-copier

A really small and cheap Python 3 Script that I use when I am expected to write in proper Spanish using accent marks.

# Usage

There are two ways to use this.

1. From the commandline, run without any arguments.

or

2. Also from the Commandline, pass in as a argument which character you want to use, like so

`$ python accent-copier.py n`

The following gets returned and should appear on the system clipboard.

# Depends

Python 3, available in most GNU/Linux Distributions.

pyperclip, available in the pip package manager.

# Why?
Because Character Selectors are big and show me too many chars that I do not use, making it impossible to quickly type properly in Spanish on a US English keyboard.
